							<h3>First real life skill, but wow I never imagined it to be that time consuming</h3>
								<p>This week Marcello introduced us to webdesign, just like it is done at the MIT. It felt like a rollercoster. Install that, download this, create an account here, link this and boom. Honestly, I still do not really know how my VSC is connected to github and how github works in total. But you know what they say, never change a running system.</p>
								<p>We are supposed to document our module progress here which is a really refreshing method. It exposes you to new challenges, but we will come to that later. What fascinates me is how fast you could basically start a website, I guess there is a reason why webdeveloper jobs have been cut since the early 2000s. I mean we do it in an old school way but with tools like framer wix etc. it seems qutie easy to do this for an completly beignner, which is great for young start ups and businesses.</p>
								<h3>Challenges</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/PEweekPICs/FramerPage.png" alt="" /></span>At first i wanted to create a Htmö code with framer because i thought "Why build everything on your own when there are so many webside builders online?" but as it turnes out framer does not allow to copy the html,jss and css file even though it is a free design tool. Even Chatgpt could not help me get the data i need because it was not allowed to acces the side properly. I mean take a look at the side, it has amazing features and implemented functions but I had to stick to a HTML5 Up template. after some further research i really like this one and sticked to it. This page seemed to be a lot easier than it actually was hahah. I thought you just link and implemnet some pictures aand boom it is done. but as it turnd out it is a lot of work to get an website in a formst that you really like. Thankfully we livr in 2025 and there are so many tools that help you with programming. I think without chat gpt and othrt ai tools this would have taken double the time. The biggest problems till this point where:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>images, video format</li>
									<li>File size </li>
									<li>Folder and link structure </li>
									<li>css js implementations</li>
									<li>datatransfer</li>
								</ul>
								
							</section>
							<p>After all i feel quite happy with my website of course you could spent an shear endless amount of hours filling and designing this website but for now i try to manage to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
